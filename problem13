a)
    P(D | S1, S2, S3) = P(D) * P(S1|D) * P(S2|D) * P(S3|D) / (P(S1) * P(S2) * P(S3))

b)
    P(D | S1, S2, S3) = P(D) * P(S1, S2) * P(S3 | S1, S2) / P(S1, S2, S3)

c)
    The probablities in part b, specificially the one that defines S3 based on S1 and S2,
    are different because the Symptoms are now reliant on eachother to some extent.  By
    this I mean the symptoms are no longer conditionally independent.  In part A we
    assumed that symptoms were independent and had no effect on eachother, while in part
    b we did not have that assumption.

    Naive Bayes assumes that the variables are not at all related, this is generally not
    true in real life.

d)
    Is A|D,B  d-separable from C|D,B? Give reasons for your answer!

        d is d-seperable

        the path from A to C with repect to D and B is blocked at the verticie D because
        A->D->E is a head to tail relationship and D is in the set of nodes we are
        seperating with repect to

        the path from C to A is blocked with respect to B and D because C->E->D is a
        head to head and E is not in our set of nodes we are seperating with repect to.


    Is A,E| d-separable from  C|? Give reasons for your answer! :=”no evidence”

        A,E -> C will not be d-seperable if there is any head to head relationship
        between vertexes along the way, since there is no evidence for nodes of us to
        take the d seperation with repect to.

        A,E and C are indeed d-seperable
