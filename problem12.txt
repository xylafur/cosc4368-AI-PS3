    remove implications
        VxVy]z (~P(x, y, z) v R(x, y))

    move ~ inwards
        seems to not need this step

    standardize variables
        doesn't need this step

    skolemize:
        VxVy (~P(x, y, F(x, y)) v R(x, y))

        - not really sure if should be replacing z with F(x, y) or F(z)
            - see page 346

    drop universal quantifiers
        ~P(x, y, F(x, y)) v R(x, y)

    distribute ^ over v
        don't need this step since we only have the two halves


    binary resolution
        there are only the two clauses, nothing to unify

    final solution:
        ~P(x, y, F(x, y)) v R(x, y)

    Not sure if this is a typo on their part... skipping for now
